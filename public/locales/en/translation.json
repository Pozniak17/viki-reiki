    "text": "My journey into the world of Reiki began as a search for a deeper meaning in life. I always felt that my purpose was to help people, but it was only when I discovered this ancient Japanese practice that everything fell into place. Reiki became more than just a practice for me — it became a path to healing, harmony, and inner awakening. I immersed myself in studying this art, delving deep into its wisdom, and soon realized that this was what I wanted to share with the world. Every session I conducted felt like a new story — a story of transformation, renewal, and inspiration. People came to me in search of peace, balance, and strength, and I witnessed how their eyes filled with light after our sessions. It was truly magical."
