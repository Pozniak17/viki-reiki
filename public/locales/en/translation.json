    "secondTitle": "Finding My Purpose Through Reiki",
    "text": "My journey into the world of Reiki took on a new meaning in 2019 when the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic. During this challenging time, many people sought support and healing, and I felt an even stronger calling to help others cope with stress and uncertainty. I began to study and practice Reiki intensively, deepening my understanding of how this ancient Japanese method could benefit people in the modern world. Due to quarantine restrictions, I started offering online sessions, which allowed me to support clients far beyond my city. Working with those who experienced loss and hardship, I realized the true power of emotional support and energy healing. Each session proved to me that Reiki is a powerful tool for restoring inner balance and harmony."
